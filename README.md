Dasshy enables creating real-time streaming models and batch analytic models for processing of any types of events(metrics).

It enables creating of policies for real-time processing as well as creating on-demand analytic queries with miliseconds execution time.

It uses a Big Data Analytics tools (Kafka, Spark SQL, Cassandra) for creating models for processing the data (filter, transform, persist) on the fly and enables querying and aggregating the data in near real-time
